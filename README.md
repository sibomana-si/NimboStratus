# NimboStratus
This is a collection of scripts that implement the three framework configurations (Split-Trust, Counter-Collusion, and Counter-CovertChannels)
described in the paper Modularizing Trust: A Framework for Cloud Storage Security (PDF copy is included in this repository).
The scripts for each configuration, are included under a directory named after the configuration. Also included in each configuration's directory, 
is a README file that presents a short tutorial on how to setup the configuration.

# Modularizing Trust
The Modularizing Trust project addresses the issue of enabling users of cloud storage services to securely store their data in 
the cloud.
We propose a framework that enables the distribution of trust over the components of the system used to synchronize the user’s 
data to the CSP’s infrastructure. Our approach consists of dividing the system into isolated components, with limited capabilities,
and relies on core operating system mechanisms to limit the components' capabilities.
